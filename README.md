# our_study
A repository to hold the scripts of our study
The folder contains the needed files of our study on decomposing, modeling and forecasting VIX index for multiple forecast horizons. 

The python scripts were developed via spyder and run in their full functionaity through anaconda. The emd, hvd and ssa scripts are designed in a fashion so as the user run and easily replicate specific processes and models, that are described in our work and contuct the MSE test and gather the returns of the tradying strategy for up to 10 days ahead forecast horizon. 
Not all processes can be replicated exactly since original checks were handled and devolped through microsoft excel and there will be some deviations since in the original study the roll of vix futures is taken into account in the final recorded returns, something that is not viable through the present scripts.
